  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to the other parent about settling the case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some parents want to work out the issues by agreement   without the judge deciding and are able to talk to each other in person,   on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.  </p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way   to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone   else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside   the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>figure out the important issues in the   disagreement</li>
    <li>explain and understand each other's needs</li>
    <li>clear up misunderstandings</li>
    <li>explore creative solutions</li>
    <li>reach acceptable agreements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Parents can hire their own private mediator to help   resolve any issue in the case.  If there   was abuse or domestic violence in your marriage, be sure to hire someone with   training and experience working with domestic violence, and tell your mediator   if you want to bring a trusted support person with you. <br>

    If you both agree, you can change things on your own.  <br>
    Whether or not you must tell the court depends on the type   of change you make.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you make a minor change, such as changing a   pick-up time by an hour, or a change to the holiday schedule, you do not have   to tell the court.</li>
    <li>If you make a change about something big, like   changing the parenting schedule from weekends with one parent to week on / week   off, tell the court in writing.</li>
    <li>If you want to be sure you are both bound by the   new agreement, tell the court in writing so the judge can make the agreement   part of the court order in your case.</li>
    <li>If you want to change child support because   either the parenting schedule or a parent's income changes, you should always   tell the court in writing so the judge can decide whether the child support   amount should change.  The parent who   owes money under the child support order you want to change will continue to   owe that amount until the judge signs a new order.</li>

  Step ${ reconsideration_idx }: Ask the court to change a decision it made in   the last 10 days<br>
content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  <p>A <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong> asks a judge to change a decision or order made in the last 10 days.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Timing</div>
  <ul>
    <li>File a <strong>Motion   for Reconsideration</strong> of an order within 10 days of the day the order was   distributed to the parents.</li>
    <li>You can find this date by looking at the end of   the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the   parents.</li>
    <li>If the 10th day is a Friday, weekend, or   holiday, your Motion for Reconsideration is due the next day that is not a   Friday, weekend or holiday.  For example,   if the 10th day was Thursday, November 23rd, and it was Thanksgiving, your   Motion for Reconsideration would not be due until the following Monday.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Reasons for Reconsideration</div>
  <p>A <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong> is based on one of the reasons listed in Civil Rule 77(k):
  <ol>
    <li> The court has overlooked, misapplied or failed to   consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. (This means the   court made a mistake in applying the law to the case.)<br>
        For example, Civil Rule 90.3 states the child support calculations for different parenting arrangements. If there is one child primarily living with one parent, Rule 90.3 states the other parent is supposed to pay 20% of their adjusted annual income to the other parent for the child support. If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead of 20%, the motion for reconsideration would state that the judge used the wrong percent amount in Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
    <li>The court has overlooked or misconceived some material   fact or proposition of law. (This means the court got an important fact wrong.)<br>
        For example, the parents both agree and tell the judge   that mom makes $25,000 every year.    However, the judge calculates child support using $35,000 for mom's   income.  The mom could file a motion for   reconsideration stating that the judge used the wrong income to determine child support.</li>
    <li> The court has overlooked or misconceived a material   question in the case. (This means the court misunderstood what you were asking   for in your case or in a motion.)<br>
        For example, to modify child support, there must be:
    <ul>
        <li>a 15% change in the amount of child support   ordered (this means that when you calculate support based on the parents'   current income now, it is 15% more or less than the current support order), or </li>
        <li>a change in the parenting plan from primary   custody to shared custody or vice versa that affects the child support formula.</li>
        <li>Mother filed a motion to modify child support   because the son moved from living full-time with Father to Mother.  The judge denied the motion because there was   not a 15% change in the child support amount.    Mother can file a motion for reconsideration, stating the court   overlooked the question of whether there was a change in the parenting plan.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later   court decision or statute. (This means the court applied a rule or law that   changed.)<br>
    For example, on April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to allow a   parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their gross income   (up to 10% of the parent's gross income). If the court calculated child support   on April 14 without the health insurance deduction, the parent could file a   motion for reconsideration based on the changed Civil Rule 90.3.</li>

content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  <ul>
    <li>When your case was opened, the court issued an   order, usually called a Standing Order or a Domestic Relations Procedural   Order.  The court expects both parents to   follow it.</li>
    <li>Sometimes a parent wants to do something not   allowed under the Standing Order.  For   example, the Standing Order says that parents cannot remove the children from   Alaska during the case.  A parent may   want to take the children to a family reunion in Washington.</li>
    <li>If you want to do something different than what is allowed under this kind of order, you can ask the other parent and try to agree.</li>
    <li>If you do not agree, you can ask the court to change one of the orders by filing a document called a &quot;motion&quot;.</li>

content: |
 <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
 <p>An appeal is when the Alaska Supreme Court reviews the trial judge's decision in your custody case. The process is complicated, expensive, and can take over two years. It is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information. In an appeal you argue that the custody trial judge made a legal mistake. The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:<br>
 the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court;<br>
 any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court;<br>
 the documents in the lower court or agency record; and<br>
 appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court. </p>
 <div class="step-subheading">Cost</div>
 <p>To start an appeal, you must pay a $250 filing fee, a $750 bond or deposit for costs, as well as other costs such as preparing the transcript. Read more about <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/payforappeal.htm">the costs of an appeal.</a><br>

 Step ${ set_aside_idx }: Ask the court to Set Aside a Final Order and make a different decision
content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  <p>A <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> asks the trial court to set aside or &quot;undo&quot; a judgment or final order in a case. If granted, the case will move ahead as if the judgment had not been made. Your <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> must state a reason in Civil Rule 60 why the court should set aside the judgment or order. This is often difficult and examples are listed below. Courts rarely grant a <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong>.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Timing</div>
  <p>You must file your <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> within a &quot;reasonable time&quot; after the judgment or order. You should clearly explain why the time in which they filed the motion is reasonable. It is important to act promptly. The judge decides what a reasonable amount of time is, and it will depend on the circumstances in the case. If you do not file the <strong>Motion to Set Aside</strong> within a reasonable time, the judge can deny it, even if the reason for the request is valid. <br>
  There is a different deadline if you want to set aside for one of the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,</li>
  <li>newly discovered evidence, or</li>
  <li>fraud, misrepresentation or misconduct of the other party.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You must file:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>within a reasonable time, and </li>
  <li><strong>within 1 year</strong> of the final judgment or order.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Reasons for Setting Aside a Judgment or Order</div>
  <p>A <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> is based on one of the reasons listed in Civil Rule 60(a) and (b).<br>
  <strong>Civil Rule 60(a) </strong>provides that a party can file a<strong> Motion to Set Aside the Judgment or Order</strong> if the court made a clerical mistake or accidentally left something out of a document. For example, if the court accidently wrote the wrong date for a child's date of birth.<br>
  <strong>Civil Rule 60(b)</strong> specifies the reasons the court may set aside a judgment which include:<br>
  If your <strong>Motion to Set Aside the Judgment or Order</strong> is based on one of the following reasons, you must file within 1 year from the date the court distributed the Judgment or Order:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>One of the parents making a mistake; not paying close attention (inadvertence); an unexpected action, sudden confusion or an unanticipated event (surprise), or a legitimate excuse for failing to take required action (excusable neglect). For example, you ask to set aside the decision made at a hearing you missed because you had a heart attack the day before and were in the ICU so couldn't participate.</li>
  <li>Newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by taking reasonable steps within 10 days of the judgment. For example, it may be newly discovered evidence if you learn one month after trial that the other parent was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol a week before the trial.</li>
  <li>Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct from the other side. For example, one parent forges documents that say his or her criminal case was dismissed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your <strong>Motion to Set Aside the Judgment or Order</strong> is based on one of the following reasons, you must file within a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time from the date the court distributed the Judgment or Order:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The judgment is void. For example, an Alaska court generally does not have the authority, called jurisdiction, to make a parenting plan for a child living 6 or more months in another state. If a parent hid from the other parent and the court that their child had been living in Oregon for the 6 months before the custody case, the parenting plan order would be void. </li>
  <li>The judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated or it is no longer fair that the judgment should apply at this time. For example, a court may find that a father's child support order is no longer fair if the father learned for the first time, 4 years after the custody case, that he is not the child's biological father.</li>
  <li>Any other reason justifying relief from the judgment. This cannot be one of the reasons listed above - it must be something different.</li>
  </ul>

  Step ${ ak_jurisdiction_idx }: Make sure that the Alaska court has the authority to change the order
content: |
  <ul>
  <li>A court must have the authority called jurisdiction to issue an order about a custody or parenting plan or a child support order.</li>
  <li>Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months can make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's &quot;home state.&quot;</li>
  <li>Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state." This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months. <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm">Talking to a lawyer</a> can help you decide which is the best state for your case.</li>

  % endif
  The courts want children to have a regular schedule without a lot of changes. So the courts will generally only change a custody and parenting plan or child support order if there is a change of circumstances. Some examples are: <br>
  <strong>For custody</strong>, a change in circumstances means something has happened so that the old custody or parenting plan is no longer in the children's best interests. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>the original plan was for an infant and now the child will start kindergarten so the old schedule of 10 am exchanges does not work;</li>
  <li>one parent is moving out of state so the existing schedule of week on / week off is impossible;</li>
  <li>the parents share parenting time and one parent just went to jail so the existing schedule is impossible;</li>
  <li>an act of domestic violence between the parents when returning the children.<br>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>For child support</strong>, there generally needs to be:
  <ul>
  <li>a 15% change in the amount of child support ordered (this means that when you calculate the new child support amount, it is 15% more or less than what it has been), or</li>
  <li>a change in the parenting plan from primary custody to shared custody or vice versa that affects the child support formula.</li>
  </ul>
  % if (final_order_date_within_10_days or final_order_date_within_15_days) and modify_within_15_days:
  <div class="step-subheading">Timing</div>
  <p>A court will rarely grant a <strong>Motion to Modify </strong>made within 15 days of when the court made its final custody order unless something unexpected happened. Examples of why a court may grant a <strong>Motion to Modify</strong> are listed below.

  <li>Do not respond to a <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong> unless the court asks you for a response, usually in a written order or notice. The court usually sets a deadline for a response.

You can find this date by looking at the end of the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the parents.</li>
  <li>There will not be a hearing.</li>
  <li>The court may write a decision, but if the court does not issue a decision 30 days after the motion or response was filed, <strong>whichever is later</strong>, the <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong> is denied, which means the original decision is not changed.</li>
  <li>If the court grants the a <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong>, it will either enter a new order or ask both sides for more information.</li>

  Step ${ file_reconsider_response_idx }: File and serve your response within 10 or 13 days

  You have 10 days if delivered by hand and 13 days from the day you mailed your response.

  Make 2 copies of your response. Keep 1 copy for your own records.

  You must give the other parent, or their lawyer if they have one, 1 copy of everything you file with the court. You can mail or hand deliver it. Do this the day you file your motion. This is called "serving" the other side. You have to write how you serve the other parent on your motion.

  File the original with the court by the deadline (10 or 13 days). If the deadline is a Friday, weekend, or holiday, your response is due the next day that is not a Friday, weekend or holiday. For example, if the 10th day was Thursday, November 23rd, and it was Thanksgiving, your response would not be due until the following Monday.

  An appeal is when the Alaska Supreme Court reviews the judge's decision in your custody case. The process is complicated, expensive, and can take over two years. It is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information. In an appeal you argue that the custody judge made a legal mistake. The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  <ul>
  <li>the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court (or a written transcript of the recording);</li>
  <li>any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court;</li>
  <li>the documents in the lower court or agency record; and</li>
  <li>appeal briefs that are the written arguments why the trial judge made a mistake filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court. </li>
  </ul>
  % if respond_to_appeal == 'agree':
  The Alaska Court System Appeals </a><a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appeals.htm">Webpage</a> has a lot of information about the process. You can also review a <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_1000.pdf">timeline for the steps in an appeal</a>.
  <div class="step-subheading">Agreement</div>
  If you agree with what the other parent is asking for in the appeal, you have some options.
  <ul>
  <li>Contact the other parent and write out your agreement. See Step 35.</li>
  <li>Tell the Alaska Supreme Court in writing you will not be a part of the appeal. See Step 36.</li>

  <div class="step-subheading">Process</div>
  If you receive papers saying the other parent filed an appeal, you need to prepare to respond. There are several times during the appeal that you need to be active:
  <ul>
  <li>after receiving the papers from the other parent that start the appeal;</li>
  <li>when deciding whether to file your own appeal too which is called a "cross appeal;"</li>
  <li>when writing a response called a brief to the other parent's opening brief (written argument why the trial court decision should be changed); and</li>
  <li>when preparing for oral argument where both sides appear in the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#supremecourt">Supreme Court</a> and each side argues their case and the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#justice">justices</a> may ask questions.</li>
  </ul>
  This Alaska Court System Appeals <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appeals.htm">Webpage</a> has information about each of these steps and how you can prepare your side of the case.
