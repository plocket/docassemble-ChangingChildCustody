  Changing your custody or Parenting Plan order
subquestion: |
  Before you ask the court to change an order:
  
  Make sure you read all your paperwork to understand what it says. It is important to understand that judges make decisions according to the law and previous decisions from the Alaska Supreme Court. 
  
  Be aware that just because you do not like the outcome does not mean the judge made a mistake. 
  
  Also be aware that there are deadlines to take most actions and if you do not file the right document in time, you may be unable to file it.

      You have different ways to ask the court to change your child support order when your situation changes.  It can depend on when the court sent you the order.
  
      For the first 10 days after {the court sent your custody or Parenting Plan order}, you can file a “Motion to Reconsider."  It asks the trial judge to fix something they overlooked or misunderstood.
       
        After 10 days, you can file a “Motion to Modify.”
       
        Your Action Plan will not include information about options that do not apply in your case.

  For 10 days after the court decides a motion, you can file a Motion to Reconsider and ask the same judge to change part or all of the decision.

  You may be able to file a **late** motion for reconsideration if you have a good reason for missing the 10 day deadline. The decision to accept your motion for reconsideration is up to the judge entirely. They may refuse to accept it.

id: Do you want information about changing a standing order
question: |
  Do you want information about changing a standing order?

  Sometimes the court issues orders without being asked, like the standing order at the beginning of your case. 
  
  If you want to change something in the order, you can file a “motion” asking the court for the change.
yesno: standing_order
under: |
  #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
  The standing order says that parents cannot remove the children from Alaska during the case. 

  If a parent wants to take the children to a family reunion in Washington, and the other parent doesn’t agree, you can file a motion asking the court to change the order to allow the children to travel.
